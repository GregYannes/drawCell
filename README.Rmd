# drawCell

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of drawCell is to easily obtain nice cell pictures in R!



## Installation

drawCell needs the package [webshot2](https://github.com/rstudio/webshot2), 
which needs to be installed. 

To obtain the cell pictures, draCell connects to the
[SwissBioPics API](https://www.swissbiopics.org/) so an internet connection 
is required.

``` {r installation, eval= FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("svalvaro/drawCell")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:



It requires the [taxonomy id](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/) of your
species of interest, and one or multiple SL codes for subcellular locations 
that will be colored. The SL codes for each subcellular location can be found at
[Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/docs/subcell) and
[uniprotkb_sl2go](http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/external2go/uniprotkb_sl2go).


The taxonomy id for *Quercus ilex* a common tree in the south of Spain is
`58334` and as an example I will use the SL code of the chloroplast: `0049`.




```{r plantcell2, eval=FALSE}

library(drawCell)

drawCell(taxonomy_id = '58334', sl_ids = '0049', color = 'lightblue', delay = 3)

```

We can also obtain pictures of viruses, yeast, and pretty much everything that exists!

For the baker's yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* whose taxonomy id is `4932` we will highlight the nucleus: `0191` and the vacuole: `0272`.



```{r sacc2, eval = FALSE}

drawCell(taxonomy_id = '4932', sl_ids = c('0191', '0272'))
```
